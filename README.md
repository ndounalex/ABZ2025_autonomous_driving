# cASTD and eASTD installation
The installation procedure for eASTD and cASTD can be found in the [here](https://github.com/ndounalex/ASTD-tools).

## Wiki

Go to page [cASTD Wiki](https://depot.gril.usherbrooke.ca/lionel-tidjon/castd/wikis/home)

## Technical documentation

The translation rules and the compilation approach are available [here](https://github.com/DiegoOliveiraUDES/astd-tech-report-27).

## ReadTheDocs

Check our full documentation [online](https://castd.readthedocs.io/).

## Description

our warehouse is mainly made up of the following elements:
- the .eastd file, which contains the eastd specification for the case study.
- the .json file, which corresponds to the JSON generated by eastd and used by cASTD to generate the C++ code.
- the config.txt file, which contains the default values for the various controller input attributes in accordance with the specification.
- the readConfig.cpp file, which is our utility file containing the complex Parameters type used in the specification to store attribute values and containing the functions for reading the configuration file and saving attribute values in the configuration file when the ventilator is switched off.
- the execution folder contains the various test cases carried out on our specification. For each test case we have an input file containing all the commands executed for the test case and an output file containing the output obtained during the test. Due to certain limitations in our cASTD tool, we were unable to test our overall specification, but divided it into sub-modules that we tested individually. We have a test module for the PCV mode, a test module for the PSV mode and a test module covering the other controller states, namely Start-up, SelfTest, FailSafe, VentilationOff, and so on.

## Training and testing of agents

Setup:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The agent for the Highway Environment can be trained or tested via command line:

```bash
# To train a new model (save under models/highway_env):
python highway_agent.py train


# Loads the trained model and runs and renders episodes over its behaviour:
python highway_agent.py test
```


## Scenarios


In the following, we provide some scenarios for a single-agent controller.
The controlled vehicle (ego vehicle) is marked in red.
Rosa vehicles are vehicles in the same lane for which the safety distance is relevant.
Purple vehicles are vehicles for which the distance will become relevant when switching lanes.
Blue vehicles are vehicles for which the safety distance will not be relevant in the next cycle.


## Scenario 1


| <img src="images/Scenario1_1.png" alt="Scenario 1.1" width="150%">                         | <img src="images/Scenario1_2.png" alt="Scenario 1.2" width="150%"> | <img src="images/Scenario1_3.png" alt="Scenario 1.3" width="150%"> |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A vehicle approaches another vehicle in the same lane from behind, the distance decreases. | The Ego vehicle brakes.                                            |The Ego vehicle continues braking to maintain the safety distance. |


## Scenario 2

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A vehicle approaches another vehicle in the same lane from behind, the distance decreases. | The Ego vehicle switches to the right lane.  | The Ego vehicle completes switching to the right lane and accelerates.   |


## Scenario 3

 ![Scenario 3](images/Scenario3_1.png)                   | ![Scenario 3](images/Scenario3_2.png)                                              | ![Scenario 3](images/Scenario3_3.png)       
|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| There is another vehicle on another lane further right. | The Ego vehicle switches to the right lane, as the safety distance is maintained.  | The Ego  vehicle continues driving forward. |


## Scenario 4

![Scenario 4](images/Scenario4_1.png)                   | ![Scenario 4](images/Scenario4_2.png)                                                       | ![Scenario 4](images/Scenario4_3.png)
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| There is another vehicle on another lane further right. | The Ego vehicle cannot switch to the center lane, as the safety distance is not maintained. | The Ego vehicle continues driving forward.  |


## Scenario 5

 ![Scenario 5](images/Scenario5_1.png)         | ![Scenario 5](images/Scenario5_2.png)           | ![Scenario 5](images/Scenario5_3.png)                                                 
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The Ego Vehicle drives on the left-most lane. | There is another vehicle on the right-most lane | Both vehicles decide to switch to the center lane, while maintaining safety distances |
